# About me
A data scientist passionate about providing solutions to environmental needs. Armed in QGIS, R and
python for spatial analysis and automation. I generate insight for industry decisions; real estate,
climate, transportation, agriculture. I promote company net ratio and be of value wherever I find
myself. I work remotely or on-site and equally love hybrid. With me, data quality is assured whilst also
ensuring timely analysis.
Willing to relocate: Anywhere


## WORK EXPERIENCE
GIS Scientist,
Walulel - Accra, 
May 2018 to Present

• Build models and develop python scripts within QGIS to automate spatial metric analysis workflow.
Models and python scripts analyse metrics ;air quality, conservation areas , urban islands, schools,
opportunity areas, house price, transport, congestion charge zones. These metrics are analysed timely
to be embedded on WaInsight, a real estate location intelligent software platform for London.

• Strategise data scraping and retrieval of open source data to be used for policy planning analysis for
London. Data quality is assured whilst connections to WMS, WMTS, WFS, WCS, REST API, https protocols
data are deciphered and obtained with scripts in R. geojsonsf. Consideration to connections to storing
images in bytea in PostgreSQL via POSTgis is given to raster layers which require processing to vectors.

• Georeferencing non-spatial planning policy pdfs of Greater London to ensure accurate extraction
of shapefiles and geopackages in EPSG 27700, EPSG 3857. The layers, including but not limited to
residential , nature and environment, heritage, regeneration.

• Troubleshooting data issues to fix in QGIS for data upload process.

• Set up and refine a spatial data pipeline which automates spatial metric analysis in the area of
demographics, built environment, amenities using drake, an R studio workflow library. Proximity analysis,
network analysis, geolocation analysis are some analysis done with sf, sp, ppp packages in R studio. Data
stored in bitbucket is analysed swiftly and CSV results churned out upon button click.

• Collaborate with developers, UI/UX designers by ensuring features for web and mobile versions of
applications are developed. Features such as geolocation grid to track user behaviour, proximity analysis
to define customer radius have been implemented and are continually updated to meet the needs of
the user.

• Prepare technical documents on application reviews and clearly bring to the fore spatial strategies
which address user needs.
• Validated average building height in London by bringing context to canopy height models using DSM
and DTM.

• Classified buildings by architecture, use and style by digitising buildings using QGIS and google maps.

• Liaised with Jas Bhalla Architects to prepare heatmaps for affordable housing designs. Jas Bhalla
Architects and Walulel won the 2019 William Sutton Prize

• Built a database of digitised road classes built from scratch for London with cycle routes which informs
users on link -node ratio, classes of roads.


## Backend Django Developer and Data Visualisation expert
Freelancer,
January 2020 to November 2022

• Develop location-aware apps with geodjango and django rest api. Postgres database stores models.

• As a cartographer, I have composed static maps which depict study areas. Some of these maps
show forest reserves, wetlands, settlements. Geoprocessing algorithms were applied to present fine
visualisations. https://github.com/kof1nti/nearest

• Web map of a suburb in Ghana showing 100m grids has been visualised to provide insight into
geolocation. https://kof1nti.github.io/numero.github.io/#12/5.6833/0.0118

• Web map showing planning policy of Greater London has been visualised. This map provides meaning
into policy constraints of London Postcodes. https://kof1nti.github.io/webpolicy/

• Built dashboards for survey responses with ARCGIS survey 123.




## Data Analyst and Regression Expert
Freelance,
March 2022 to July 2022

• Consult on using R studio for data analysis and econometrics with focus on building regression models
with graphs and interpretations.

• Tutor spatial analysis with R, QGIS and python using real world scenarios. Addressed concerns and
intensified trainee's urge on the power of spatial analysis in decision making.

• Introduce trainee to the power of data visualisations in decison making by giving considerations to
Tableau, plotly, seaborn, geojsonio, matplotlib and QGIS.

• Offer pro-bono services on geospatial analysis---satellite imagery analysis, machine learning, map
composition.


## Geospatial data sourcing expert and Analyst,
Freelancer,
June 2021 to August 2021

• Sourced geospatial data in the area of built environment, demographics, amenities which can be used to
build a location intelligent platform. I ensured that data sourced were accurate and to the right standard
when used for spatial analysis

• Validated data offerings from mobility data providers using spatial analysis in QGIS and R . Meetings
were scheduled with providers, data needs were presented and feedbacks were documented accordingly.
This ensured data offerings were understood and reviewed.

• A report of data needs, consideration and recommendations was presented. This report served as a
guide for development of a location intelligent product

## Python GIS developer/Machine Learning

Freelancer

June 2021 to August 2021

• Built a land cover detection model using sentinel images.

• I tutored on using QGIS and machine learning with focus on applying algorithms to detect weeds in
a plantation. This was achieved by building a detection algorithm using dzetsaka and semi-automatic
classification plugin incorporating random forest, SVM and GMM models.

• Aided trainee in setting up a git hub page website and pages to visualise web map composed in QGIS.

• Introduced trainee to anaconda, jupyter notebook and python libraries such as open cv, tensor flow,
geopandas. A detection model was developed to detect weeds in a plantation.


## Quality Assurance Analyst, GIS
Safegraph

July 2021 to July 2021
• Evaluated Safegraph’s, a data-as-a-service company core places location data to determine where 
customers could be picked up or dropped off, for sampled locations in Vancouver, Chicago and 
Greater Manchester. 

• Ensured context was brought to the types of places people visit for advertising purposes using 
Safegraph Points-of-Interest dataset.

• Cross-referenced and analyzed similar data offers from competitors to determine whether Safegraph’s 
set price points for 1 year license with updates was ideal.

• Provided a guide which indicates instances where dataset adds value to business use cases-navigation 
and advertising acting in the portfolio of a Director of Data Acquisitions at Uber.

## Surveyor

Joeamah Geomatic Consult - Accra

June 2017 to August 2017

• As part of an asset mapping project of the Electricity Company of Ghana, I mapped metred and nonmetred assets including houses, electric poles.

• With the aid of an automatic level, total station and drones, setting out surveys and detailing were
done for a section of Ridge Hospital as part of a phase two project. In the end a misclose and an accuracy
were achieved.

• Ground truthing a part in Accra was done to ensure map produced was accurate. Omissions and errors
were duly noted and applied.

## Surveyor and CAD expert

Survey and Mapping Division

May 2015 to August 2015

• Prepared new site plans for land owners. This was done to ensure owners had the updated site plans
in lieu of old ones. Auto cad was used in preparing site plans.

• Demarcated plots of lands.

• Prepared and compiled survey reports to be signed by Regional Surveyors. I ensured checks were
done and corrected of errors.
